# RaspberryPi-Troubleshooting
This repository details solutions to common issues involving Raspberry Pi's. The primary focus is looking at the different methods to resolve network connection issues that occur with eduroam. 

## Initial Start-Up Raspberry Pi's 
1. Will need to select the proper keyboard and language first
2. (FOR DESKTOP GUI ONLUY) Next will need to establish whether or not there is a black border.
3. Connect to Wifi
 * For Oregon State Univeristy connect to Visitor, use vistor for initial installations and updates.
 * To connect to Vistor make sure to open browser to establish the connection

4. Update 
 * Follow the pis instructions and update it accordingly so that both the time and the OS are adequately up to date

5. Restart
 * Afer this point the pi can be rebooted.


## Switching to Wifi-Access Point or Eduroam:

> After the initial start up of the pi has been completed then you may decide whether to follow the documentation in establishing wifi connection through Eduroam
> or rather set a pi as a wifi access point

> These are two separate methods, and are not compatible based on current implementation.

> See "Eduroam Connection" for the guide on how to connection to Eduroam

> See "Pi Wifi-Access Point" for the guide on developing and connecting to a wifi access point.
